import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: Yes, they are both optionals. The difference between the 2 sets of variables is that the instance variables have the "!", which means the optionals
//: automatically unwrap (implicitly wrapped optionals), whereas the values passed into **init** must be unwrapped manually by adding the "!" later on.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: arePalindromes is initially an instance method not a class/static method, so it must be called through an instance of the Words class, not the class itself. To fix this, we had to add the "class" keyword in front of the method to show it is a class method.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool? {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [:] //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_,count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return nil
    }
}
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: countLetters was declared but not instantiated in line X, and in Line Y we tried to use it but it did not have a value as it was not instantiated. Removed "class" keyword as it is an instance method, not a class/static method. Changed output type to optional (Bool?) since it may return nil. Lastly (but not as important), change "var" to "let" for lenA, lenB as the values of these variables are immutable (did so as per request of Xcode).
